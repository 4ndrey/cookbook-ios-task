# Ackee Cookbook iOS Version

Welcome! Wanna join [Ackee][1]? Or you just dont know what to do on lazy sunday afternoon ?

Here is an Task for you ! Create iOS version of delicious ackee recipes. We have everything you need to get started 
- API (and running server)
- Designs
- Simple iOS skeleton with some prepared code

it should take you around 2-4 hours to complete 

## API & Server
Documentation for the api can be found on [apiary][2]
live server can be visited on address [https://cookbook.ack.ee][3]

## Designs 
App contains those 3 screens. XCode project already has all neccessary assets but you can open original [Sketch][4] file from respository if you need to.

## App 
We have created project automatically for you, which includes XcodeWorkspace with required Pods. We also included simple Reactive wrapper over API and example (in `MasterViewController.swift`)

### Tasks for you 

- Write the app :)
- Use as much standards as we do in our [iOS Cookbook][5]
- Using Reactive Swift  and MVVM Architecture is big advantage
- Writing UI programatically is also big advantage ( if you use snapkit, we will love you)
- The generated code is Xcode Master-Detail MVC template feel free to change it!
- If you want to add anything extra, just go for it!
- Send it to us as link to dropbox / GDrive / etc..
